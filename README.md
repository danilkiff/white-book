# White Book: The Silent Drift of Knowledge

> [!TIP]
> A PDF version of the current draft is available as [release artifact](https://github.com/danilkiff/white-book/releases). 

This repository contains the source of the **White Book**, written in LaTeX, 
typeset for clarity, and structured to support margin-based annotation, 
versioned insight development, and citation integrity.

In a noisy academic landscape, this project pursues a singular goal: 
to reclaim structured thought as a first-class object of scientific publication.

DOI will be minted via [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) upon release.

## Two-channel model

Each chapter follows a two-channel model: main flow (`reasoning`) + 
marginalia (`meta-insight`, `skepticism`, `repair hooks`). It is not 
just a stylistic choice, but cognitive tool designed to counteract 
the erosion of deep reasoning:

**Main flow** builds explicit causal chains, ensuring that each
claim is grounded in logical progression.

**Marginalia** (`skepticism`, `repair hooks`) creates friction:
  
  - Questions and counterarguments prevent premature closure.
  - Versioned insights (`meta-insight`) track the evolution of 
    ideas, making knowledge integration visible.

**Citation integrity** ensures traceability: every assertion is linked
to sources, reducing reliance on "knowledge by authority".

This format mirrors the book's thesis: structured thought must be *reclaimed*
through deliberate design — not left to the entropy of search-driven cognition.

## Who is this for?

- Researchers working on AGI, formal systems, verifiable computation
- Builders of trust infrastructure, reasoning engines, and autonomous cognitive systems
- Thinkers who prefer depth over trend, and traceability over belief
- Cultural theorists exploring the impact of technology on collective memory
- Cognitive scientists studying attention, reasoning, and neuroplasticity
